For this project, I worked with the SWAPI.tech API to fetch and display data on the API 📡 . 
I built a central store that manages state, including a favorites array where users can add or remove items they like. To improve performance and persistence, I used localStorage to save the store locally, preventing unnecessary API calls when the page is refreshed 💾 . 
I also implemented a search bar to explore the full data 🔍 . 

This project includes several core concepts, like fetching data from RESTful APIs, using localStorage, managing route paths, and improving UI with search functionality and dynamic rendering. It’s been a great challenge. Now it's time to dive into the Back-end 🚀
