The last front-end proyect fot 4Geeks Academy España 👾 . For this project, I worked with the SWAPI.tech API to fetch and display data on the API 📡 . 
I built a central store that manages state, including a favorites array where users can add or remove items they like. To improve performance and persistence, I used localStorage to save the store locally, preventing unnecessary API calls when the page is refreshed 💾 . 
I also implemented a search bar to explore the full data 🔍 . 

This project has helped me learn and practice several core concepts, including fetching data from RESTful APIs, using localStorage, managing route paths, and improving UI with search functionality and dynamic rendering. It’s been a great challenge. Now it's time to dive into the Back-end 🚀
